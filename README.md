# UnityAndroidDBLoader

This Unity script addresses the common issue of loading local databases in Android applications. It automatically copies a database from the `StreamingAssets` folder to the persistent asset path on Android devices, allowing for reading and writing to the database within your application.

## Example

I added a example of how it can be used to access a SQLite database

## Tested

- Unity 2022
- Unity 6
- (should work for most later Versions of Unity)
